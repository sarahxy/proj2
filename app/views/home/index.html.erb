<h5>Battle rules:</h5>
<h6>
- The attacking Character picks one of their elements (Fire, Water, Wind, Earth) to use to attack the opponent.<br>
- A random element of the opponent is used to defend against the attacker.<br>
- The damage dealt is calculated by the formula BASE_DAMAGE * ELEMENT_MULTIPLIER * RANDOM_MULTIPLIER.<br>
- If the attacker's element is the victim's element weakness, then damage is 2x! (element multiplier = 2)<br>
- The random chance multiplier simulates stochastic battle conditions. It ranges between +/- 30% per attack, so an attack might do between 70% and 130% of its base damage.<br>
- After the attack, the attacking Character will gain 10 experience points!<br>
- If the attacking Character reaches 100 EXP, it will level up, and EXP will reset to 0.<br>
